# Back-Propagation-Using-NN
I have uploaded a single .ipynb file, containing all my codes. First defined the neural network class for back propagation implementation. Then I imported data from the given 'house.csv' file and did some scaling of the data. Then I implemented the 5 fold and 10 fold cross validation method for all the three models specified as A, B, C.
